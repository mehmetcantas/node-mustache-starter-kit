## Instructions
After cloning into repo, cd to project root directory and create a .env file. This file requires a PORT (for server)

```
PORT=3000
```

Then run npm install from the root directory:

```
$ npm install
```

To run server, execute this command
```
$ npm run start
```

To build for production, run build:

```
$ npm run build
```

Happy coding !
